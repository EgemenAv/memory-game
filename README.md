  # Memory Game

  A Memory Card game.
  
  ## Description

  It is a two player memory game where a player turns over two of the face down cards each turn. If the pictures on the cards match, the player earns a point and continue their turn. If the pictures don't match, the player turns over the cards again and end their turn. The player with the highest point total wins when all the cards are face up.
